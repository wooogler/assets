# HCI Conferences that we target

Echolab targets top-tier HCI conferences for submissions, with a primary focus on ACM CHI for any type of HCI work. Specific conferences and journals are selected based on the research topic, including

- ACM CSCW for collaboration or social computing
- ACM UIST for innovative technology or UI for HCI
- ACM Creativity and Cognition for creativity and art
- ACM ICER or SIGCSE for computer science education
- IEEE VL/HCC for programming environments or computational thinking
- ACM CHIWORK for workplace-related topics
- ACM DIS for design-related topics
- ACM TOCHI (journal) for significant contributions too lengthy for conference papers
- ACM GROUP as a smaller version of ACM CSCW
- ACM CUI for conversational user interfaces
- IJHCI/IJHCS for co-authors not benefiting from conference papers.
