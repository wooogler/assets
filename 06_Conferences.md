# Funding Support for Conference Attendance

- Echolab provides funding support for conference attendance if a team member is the first author presenting a full paper at major HCI conferences such as CHI, CSCW, and UIST. Financial support for poster presentations is offered for those presented at the CHI conference and the UIST conference.
- Additionally, funding for travel is primarily allocated to the first authors of conference papers. Non-first authors may also receive funding, contingent on the location of the conference and the availability of funds. It is advisable to discuss potential funding options with the professor to explore possibilities for support.
- Echolab is actively targeting the CHI, CSCW, and UIST conferences for submitting research papers, emphasizing its commitment to advancing knowledge in the field of Human-Computer Interaction. This strategic focus not only enhances the visibility of Echolab's research but also fosters collaboration and innovation within the HCI community.
