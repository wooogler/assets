To further support students, Echolab provides a detailed list of university resources, which includes:

Echolab at Virginia Tech has established an open-door policy that encourages students to discuss any academic overwhelm, functional difficulties, or concerns about friends with their supervisors. This policy underscores the lab's commitment to the well-being and support of its students. In instances where students' needs surpass what the instructor can provide, there is a practice of guiding them to seek professional help from university resources to ensure they receive the appropriate support.

Echolab promotes awareness and accessibility of well-being resources by providing a link to a full listing of campus resources on the well-being website. These documented policies and practices highlight Echolab's dedication to creating a supportive environment that prioritizes the mental health and well-being of its students.

## Ph.D. Progress Guidelines

To ensure good academic standing and successful progress as a Ph.D. student:

- **Year 1–2:**- Form a Ph.D. committee with at least four VT faculty members.
- Failure to meet these may affect funding and standing.- Submit or publish at least one first-authored top-tier HCI paper (e.g., CHI, CSCW, UIST). For which conferences that we target, check out the conference document ([link](https://github.com/wooogler/assets/blob/master/06_Conferences.md))
- **Year 3–4:**- Schedule the preliminary exam after qualifying and forming a full committee.
- You should have at least two first-authored publications and a clear dissertation narrative.
- Identify remaining work clearly for your research defense.
- **Year 4–5:**- Conduct research defense after completing proposed work and having three first-authored papers.
- Missing this timeline may result in poor academic standing.
- **Final Defense:**- Must address committee feedback and complete research goals.
- For R1 academic careers, aim for two full top-tier first-authored papers per year.
- Teaching-oriented careers will value strong TA (preferably main instructor) experience in addition to research.
