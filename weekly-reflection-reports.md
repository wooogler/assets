# Weekly Reflection Reports at Echolab

Echolab has established a practice of submitting Weekly Reflection Reports. These reports serve the purpose of public communication among peers rather than private communication between individual team members and managers.

## Purpose
The content of these reports should include reflections on past activities and plans for future tasks.

## Submission Requirements
- It is mandatory for team members to submit these reports on a weekly basis, even if no progress has been made.
- In instances where no progress has occurred, the report should provide an explanation, such as unexpected barriers or reflections on the lack of progress.

## Goals
This practice is designed to emphasize transparency and accountability within the team.
