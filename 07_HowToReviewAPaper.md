Review Score

- Reject is something that I give when I think I have to review this paper at least two more rounds because I don't want them to revise the paper and then reject it again. 
- Major revision is something that I give when I think the paper is good but I would like to check if whether they made changes to my request.
- Minor revision is something that I give when I have a trust with the authors that they will be able to easily accomplish the changes that I request. 
- Accept is the one that I give when it is fantastic as is - no single change is needed.
