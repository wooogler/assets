# Research Questions Formulation

In Echolab, when formulating research questions (RQs), it is a practice to ensure that these questions help readers anticipate the research contribution. This involves:

- **Conveying New Knowledge**: Ensure that the RQs clearly indicate what new knowledge will be gained from the research.
- **Predicting Methods**: The RQs should hint at the methods that will be used to achieve the research goals.
- **Clarifying Significance**: It is important to clarify the significance, purpose, or problem that the research addresses.

This practice is intended to set clear expectations for the research outcomes and methodologies. Additionally, it is crucial to ensure that research questions are correctly formulated and that the paper provides clear answers to these questions. This aims to prevent paper rejection due to incorrect or poorly addressed research questions.
