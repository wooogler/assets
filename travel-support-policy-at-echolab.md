# Travel Support Policy at Echolab

Echolab at Virginia Tech may provide travel support for attending conferences, particularly if the conference is nearby. This support can be available even if the attendee is not the first author of the presentation. The decision to provide travel funding is at the discretion of the supervising professor. Individuals are encouraged to discuss their specific circumstances with their advisor or the lab's administrative staff to explore potential support options. This policy aligns with the lab's focus on fostering professional development and exposure to academic events, which are integral to the research group's mission of promoting empathic interactions through computational systems.
