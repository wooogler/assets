## Lab Attendance Policy

There is no formal in-person attendance requirement for graduate students at Echolab; however, regular lab attendance is encouraged to enhance peer connections, learn from each other, and establish a sense of community, taking advantage of the social capital coming from being in a research lab. The lab environment is designed to support productivity, and measures will be implemented if the space is underutilized, as this could lead to requests from other faculty members to use the space. In-person collaboration, while not mandatory, is promoted to create a more productive and socially connected lab atmosphere.

- Cook Counseling for appointments and 24/7 crisis support.
- Dean of Students' Office for advice and after-hours crisis support.
- Hokie Wellness for workshops and consultations on health and wellness.
- Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) for accommodations and support.

To further support students, Echolab provides a detailed list of university resources, which includes:

Echolab at Virginia Tech has established an open-door policy to encourage students to discuss any academic overwhelm, functional difficulties, or concerns about friends with their supervisors. This policy underscores the lab's commitment to student well-being and support. In instances where students' needs surpass what the instructor can provide, there is a practice of guiding them to seek professional help from university resources to ensure they receive appropriate support.

Echolab promotes awareness and accessibility of well-being resources by providing a link to a full listing of campus resources on the well-being website. These documented policies and practices highlight Echolab's dedication to creating a supportive environment that prioritizes the mental health and well-being of its students.

## Ph.D. Working Ethics (Why you should NOT do a Ph.D.)

- A Ph.D. student is a tough job because you have to do lots of different work.
- One of the challenges is that you are (typically) getting paid for less than half your working hours.
- If you are on an assistantship (GTA/GRA), this means that you are getting paid for the work that you do towards a research project or teaching. Typically, it is up to 20 hrs a week. Also, note that taking coursework does not count towards your research.
- Does that mean that your responsibility is done if you work 20 hrs? Totally. Except the fact that you will not be able to graduate and get Ph.D. if you work only 20 hrs a week because you will spend all of your time on doing something that is not going to be your dissertation unless you supervisor is super-rich and your GRA work or GTA work count towards directly your dissertation and you got multiple publications out of it.
- Other than 20 hrs a week's responsibility, the rest of the time is up to you. If you work zero hours on your research, that's fine, but you won't be able to get a Ph.D. then. Therefore, advisors have to expect you to work more hours than you are getting paid to, *not because they want to get free labor, but it is their responsibility and goal to advise their students to successfully get a Ph.D.* **More importantly, it is because that is what you signed up for**. Yes, you signed up for it. I hope nobody asked (or is forcing) you to do a Ph.D. I discourage people from doing a Ph.D. because it is a financially ridiculous thing to do.
- There are so many disciplines that have no GRA at all (i.e., social science, education, psychology, etc.). Suppose a Ph.D. student gets funded via GTA only and they don't work at all outside their teaching; this means that they are not writing their dissertation and cannot get a Ph.D.
- Some people may be extremely lucky to work as a GRA, and the work that they do directly goes to their dissertation. However, this is not common. (Or you can try your best to use your GRA projects for your dissertation). And it is not the faculty advisor's responsibility to find a GRA for their dissertation. It works based on mutual agreement and the availability of the advisor's funding.
- Given there is limited funding, you would understand that faculty members would love to avoid risks, making bets to students who proved themselves even without GRA already rather than those whom they met for the first time or had not been productive so far. I am not sure if this is right, but the current education system that evaluates faculty members based on external funding and publication outcomes encourages professors to act this way and to realize that they are not running a charity, and to prioritize equity in research funding. :(
- Let's say that you are taking two courses and one seminar (7 credits = 7 hours per week) and are working as a GTA (20 hours per week), based on the assumption that you will spend 14 hours per week for courses that you take (7 hrs for attending the class, extra 7 hrs for doing homework, preparing exams). If you work 34 hours a week for your coursework and GTA and still work zero hours for your research, you won't be able to graduate. Even before that, you won't be able to pass the qualifier exam because, typically, it is to check if the student is ready for Ph.D. research. So yes, you won't get to the point where you are done with the coursework requirement and finally have time to work on your research. Therefore, you would have to work an additional X number of hours (on top of 34 hours) to make some progress in your research with your advisor. If X is 6, it is 40 hrs a week (a typical full-time worker), but your progress is going to be slow. If X is 16, you work 50 hrs a week, and you will make more progress. If X is 0, you work 34 hours a week, but you are almost guaranteed to get no Ph.D. out of this.
- Let's face it; why would you want to work 34 hours a week and be guaranteed not to get a Ph.D.? Is this something that you want to do? Doing a Ph.D. is not for everyone. It is for something for those who would have other types of rewarding functions along the way.
- Some may ask me how many hours I have to work as a Ph.D. student. That is the wrong question. Also, some people ask me how many years it takes to get a Ph.D.? The right question is, do I want to get a Ph.D.? How quickly do I want to get it? And how many publications do I want to have by the time I graduate? What kinds of career goals do you have? How many papers did a person who achieved what you aim for have when they graduated? If you have answers to those questions, please figure out how many hours you think you have to work to accomplish your goal.

### Being Research Active during Summer

- Relatedly, I expect Ph.D. students will stay research active over the summer regardless of their funding status (GTA, no funding, GRA). Continuous involvement in research and publishing is encouraged for graduation progress. Graduate students are expected to treat their role as a full-time job, regardless of their funding source or payment status during certain periods, such as the summer. While students not receiving funding from Prof. Sang are technically not obligated to work over the summer, I expect them to make consistent progress over the summer for their own benefits, and I will expect them to regularly meet to discuss their research progress. Exceptions can be made for valid reasons, such as participating in a research internship, severe mental exhaustion, or family/personal matters, and working remotely is acceptable as long as it is discussed with the professors in advance.

## Time management

- This is purely for research hours- Not the hours you spend on other activities (etc., GRA, GTA, coursework, services). X hours in the previous section
- (Condition 1) *Know how much you want to work (Desire).*
- (Condition 2) *Keep track of your time (Reality).*- Know how much you (actually) work.
- Hint: it is not the number of hours that you use your laptop nor the number of hours that you are in school.
- Actively keep track of your time.
- I recommend that you log your time in a paper notebook. (read this: https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2013/12/21/deep-habits-the-importance-of-planning-every-minute-of-your-work-day/) or use some software such as RescueTime.
- (Condition 3) *Reduce the discrepancy.*: Match the reality with your desire, or adjust your desire to match your reality. Be honest with yourself.
- If conditions 2 and 3 are satisfied, I would like to believe that there should be no problem at all.  If you are not making any meaningful progress even when conditions 2 and 3 are satisfied, it is probably one of these cases:- Condition 2 is not really met: Your time tracking is incorrect.
- Condition 1 is not practical: There may be a misconception about what can be achieved within a limited timeframe. For instance, if your aim is to work only 5 hours a week, this will unlikely result in significant progress.
- All conditions met: Maybe research is not for you (e.g., if you work 40 hrs a week, but you are not getting anywhere, that means you chose a job that you are not capable of).

## Vacation Policy

- Being a graduate student is tough, and (hopefully) you DESERVE time off without feeling guilty and work stress. This is important to recharge yourself and gain energy for the upcoming semesters. (I call this recharging guilty feelings by doing nothing.). The only thing that I ask you is to let me know in advance so that I can cancel the meeting and do not feel offended when you completely ignore me.
- A graduate student that I advise gets 15 working days off per year. One needs to tell me 2 X N working days before the off-days, where N is the number of days that you are going to use for vacation. For example, if you are going to take a day off on Monday, you have to tell me at the latest Thursday (2 working days before Monday).
- At the beginning of every academic year (September), you will get 15 vacation days per fiscal year (sorry, no rollover).
- However, if not noted, I would assume that you will be working and responsive (online), regardless of where you are. For example, without prior notice, I will be expecting you to work during the Winter break or Spring break if you did not request vacation explicitly. (and I don't recommend that. Use vacation. You need a break.)
- Holidays defined by HR at VT are off by default. (You don't use vacation days on these days.) https://www.hr.vt.edu/benefits/leave/holiday-closing-schedule.html
- Being in a different physical location does not mean that you are forced to use your vacation day; you can be online and work remotely.
- You do not have to work on weekends or holidays (defined by HR at Virginia Tech), although you can if you would like to distribute your work flexibly. One of the benefits of being an academic is you can choose the times that you work, which means that you can distribute working hours in any way you want. However, I don't expect you to be responsive on weekends or holidays.
- Request your vacation without a guilty feeling via this form. No questions asked if you follow the policy. https://forms.gle/kwFWymeUjbrp9gVZA
