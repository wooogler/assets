# Academic Reading

## How many papers should I read?

- Ph.D. students at Echolab are encouraged to engage in extensive academic reading to stay informed about their research projects.
- There are no strict guidelines on the exact number of papers to read weekly.
- Students are recommended to aim for reading a few papers each week.
- The volume of reading may increase to 10-20 papers in certain weeks, particularly when tasks such as writing related work or discussion sections are involved.
- This practice emphasizes the importance of ongoing learning and staying updated with relevant research developments.

# Academic Writing

When formulating research questions (RQs), it is essential to ensure that they help readers anticipate the research contribution. This includes understanding what new knowledge will be gained, predicting the methods that will be used to achieve the research goals, and comprehending the significance, purpose, or problem that the research addresses. It is crucial that RQs are purpose-driven and not solely centered around the use of tools or technology. The focus should be on the intended outcome or purpose of the technology, rather than the technology itself. For example, instead of asking how a new technology can be used, frame the question around how it can achieve a specific goal or facilitate a process. This practice aids in setting clear expectations for the research outcomes and methodologies.

## Best Practices for Writing Abstracts

The following content explains what should be included in abstract. 

1. **Context and Significance**: Begin with one or two sentences explaining the context and significance of the study.
2. **Problem Statement**: Include one or two sentences detailing the problem being addressed or studied.
3. **Study Goal**: Provide one or two sentences explaining the goal of the study, which may involve describing what was done (e.g., using technologies to solve a specific issue).
4. **Methodology**: Describe the method in one or two sentences.
5. **Results**: Summarize the (anticipated) results in one or two sentences. This should be the most interesting AND significant takeaway of your study result. 
6. **Implications/Contributions** (optional): It is desriable include one or two sentences explaining the implications or contributions of the work to the world. (Now that we know what we found from this study, what does it mean to the world, i.e., people, researchers, future self). 


## How to write Introduction

- When writing the introduction for a paper, it should include a summarized version of the entire paper. This includes the motivation, goal, method, results, and learnings. The introduction should be comprehensive and transparent, avoiding surprises for the reader. The aim is to make the paper predictable and clear as early as possible. Readers should get a warm fuzzy feeling that they felt like they read the entire paper if they finish reading the introduction to the level so that they don't feel the need to read the rest of them.
- Additionally, ensure that the main points and important information are presented early in the document. Avoid saving key insights or valuable content for later sections, as readers may not continue if they do not find the initial paragraphs engaging or informative. This approach helps maintain reader engagement and comprehension, allowing readers to anticipate the progression of ideas and arguments.

## LLM-Based Generative AI Usage Guidelines for Proofreading

- It is acceptable to use a large language model like ChatGPT for proofreading. While it is recommended to proofread their papers thoroughly before submission, whoever use generative AI should ensure that the use of GPT does not alter the meaning or nuance of the original expression or disrupt the consistency of terms used. 
- If ChatGPT introduces unnecessary complexity or uses overly sophisticated language, the changes should be rejected. Making it easy to read and understand is more important that making it sound like that you are intelligent. 
- Proofreading should be done paragraph by paragraph rather than in large chunks. This is because to control the amount of content that you have to carefully review after each revision. 
- Generative AI should NOT be used for proofreading quotes from intervieweees or open-ended responses from participants.
- Do NOT use ChatGPT to generate any portion of the entire initial draft. Write on your own first.
