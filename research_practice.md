# Academic Reading

Ph.D. students at Echolab are encouraged to engage in extensive academic reading as part of their research projects. There are no strict guidelines on the exact number of papers to read weekly; however, students are recommended to aim for reading a few papers each week. The volume of reading may increase to 10-20 papers in certain weeks, especially when tasks such as writing related work or discussion sections are involved. This practice highlights the importance of ongoing learning and staying updated with relevant research developments.
