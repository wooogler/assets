# How to write Introduction

- When writing the introduction for a paper, it should include a summarized version of the entire paper. This includes the motivation, goal, method, results, and learnings. The introduction should be comprehensive and transparent, avoiding surprises for the reader. The aim is to make the paper predictable and clear as early as possible. Readers should get a warm fuzzy feeling that they felt like they read the entire paper if they finish reading introduction to the level so that they don't feel the need to read the rest of them.
