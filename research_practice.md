# Academic Reading

Ph.D. students should aim to read as many papers as possible, with a general guideline suggesting at least a few papers per week. The number of papers read may vary based on current tasks, with certain periods requiring more intensive reading, such as 10-20 papers when working on specific sections of a paper. Tracking reading habits can provide insights into one's academic engagement; for example, a professor noted reading 17 items per month.
